## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT)](https://www.zjut.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Tieming Chen](https://homepage.zjut.edu.cn/tmchen/). From 2023 to 2024, I was a visiting student at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) under the supervision of Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).

My research interests lie in:
- 🔍 **Open Source Software Governance**
- 🧩 **Software Component Analysis**
- ⚙️ **Automatic CI/CD**

Welcome to reach out to me if you are interested in my research or have any questions!
